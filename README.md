Description:
Program example to tackle the requirements below.

Issues:
Program crashes when attempting to get a second instance of the IRandomArry pointer from the factory.

Requirements:
1. Create an array poppulated with digits 0-99 such that each digit is represented once and random so as not to be consecutive, then print out the array.
2. Sort the arry and print the result out.
* use openssl to generate the random numbers.

Each .c fail contains information on how to build this version, which currently only runs in ubuntu.
There are instructions on how to have ubuntu find your libraries so the driver program runs.
